        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>At STEAM Discovery Academy students learn to think about problems and experiment with a variety of approaches to
            solve them. We foster learning and the understanding of art and science through experimentation. Students collaborate
            and communicate while exploring, discovering scientific knowledge and visualizing real-world applications. Students
            get a feel for what it is to be a real scientist. Teachers support the STEAM Discovery Academy because it integrates
            phenomenon-based learning with project-based learning. Courses encourage studentâ€™s own curiosity.
